Restro-Insider


Restro - Insider maintains a quick, hassle free digital communication between Waiters and Chefs


INTRODUCTION

With Restro - Insider, an app solution, this communication issue is solved. 
The chef can alert a waiter via the app that the food order for a particular table
is ready and waiting to be collected. The waiter receives the alert on their personal 
device either through a vibrate, flash or beep tone. This eliminates raised voices from 
the kitchen sustaining a peaceful eating environment..

The motivation to make this project came from our interest in android apps and technology 
which is spreading around the world rapidly. The traditional way of noting food orders in our 
restaurants and the procedure till the food item is served is found to be very time taking and 
burdensome. Receiving a wrong food order once after waiting for so long made us wonder, what can 
be implemented in a restaurant to accomplish maximum precision and pace? After really thinking 
about it, we finally concluded, an app solution which will help to improve the communication between 
the hotel staff, today we call as RESTRO-INSIDER. Paper wastage reduction, pleasant customer experience,
simple ways of communication between the staff, also motivated us to create this project.


WORKING AND FLOW

The app starts with 3 buttons, Chef, Waiter, and Counter buttons. So, the process starts on the waiter’s side.
Now, this part again contains 3 buttons, New Order, Order Status, and Add Menu item. So, when a new order button
is clicked it takes the user to a new screen which shows menu items fetched from the database in the form of an
interactive list (Can choose the quantity of a particular item) and it also accepts Table No. Once the order details 
are filled the user can proceed further. This will store the order details into the database Now The chef side comes
into play as soon as the order details are loaded into the database. It fetches the order details and displays them on 
to the chef side. Now here the chef gets a "Done" button for every order. Now when the chef clicks the button it updates
the order status in the database. This ends chef side work then as mentioned above the waiter has 3 buttons. 
The "Order Status" button gets to work after the chef has updated the details. This button takes the user to a screen where 
it fetches completed an order and displays them. Here a "Delete" button is available to delete the order permanently from the
database after this Coming to the third button is "Add item". It takes the user to a screen where a person can simply type the 
new dish and click Add. This will add the new dish in the database and show up while creating a new order finally the third button 
on the home page is the "Counter" button. takes you through the same process that the "Order Status" button does.
